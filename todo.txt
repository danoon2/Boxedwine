Current
1) Continue to get more games to work.

2) Get x64 dynamic recompiler to work with 16-bit games
08/08/2019 * Mostly done, some games don't work

Future: Not in any particular order

1) Find an alternative to for setjmp/longjmp, this really slows things down on Emscripten, but games like SimTower need it
11/27/2017 * Currently waiting for WASM to support this.

2) Get emscripten with webgl working, perhaps with glshim
11/27/2017 * Haven't started this yet

3) Implemented oss v4, but it can sound scratchy at times, like the intro to Diablo
11/27/2017 * It could be that emulation isn't fast enough.  This should become more clear once the x64 dynamic recompiler is done

4) Save/Load state (not sure how OpenGL would be handled)
11/29/2017 * Added

5) Android port (normal core, then maybe ARM64)
11/29/2017 * Added

6) SSE 2
08/08/2019 * Added

7) Get DirectDraw and Direct 3D to use OpenGL
08/08/2019 * Added

8) Joystick support
08/14/2019 * Added

Done

* Get OpenGL to work on Windows
11/27/2017 * I think this can be considered done

* tcp sockets
11/27/2017 * Mostly working

* add MMX instructions
11/27/2017 * This has been added, but not well tested

* MMUless with ahead of time compiling (MMUless has been put on hold, I just don't think it will be very compatible with most games)
11/27/2017 * This has been replaced with the x64 BOXEDWINE_64BIT_MMU flag.  This speeds things up quiet a bit because memory is now access as an offet.

* On x86 platforms, research a dynamic recompiler, like DosBox or maybe something more ambitious like VirtualBox
11/27/2017 * Implemented for x64.  This is more like a binaries translator from x32 to x64 with some hints of emulation. (MMU is emulated since all emulated processes are in one host process)

On Hold

* Research using less memory for the MMU (per process), perhaps a 2 index approach like the new JPC.  Currently is uses 20MB per process.
11/27/2017 * Might revisit this in the future.  For now I'm not planning any work on this
