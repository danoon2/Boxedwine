This is a build for javascript using Emscripten.  It also contains a simple web page as an example to launching games.

This contains a super stripped down version of the file system, boxedwine.zip.

boxedwine.zip can handle simple 32-bit Windows apps/games.  For 16-bit support or other games that require the full file system, please see http://www.boxedwine.org/downloads/
