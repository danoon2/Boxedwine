BoxedWine [options] Program

If no zip file is specified, it will look for a standard zip file with the pattern *Wine*.zip.  If it finds one and you didn't specifiy -nozip, then it will automatically use that zip.  It will look for this zip in the current working directory and if not found, then try the same directory where the Boxedwine executable is.  If more than 1 file is found in the directory, it will pick one at random.

If no root directory is specified, then it will default to root in your platforms data folder
* on Windows, this could be "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Boxedwine\root\"

example:

BoxedWine -root c:\root /bin/wine notepad

This will look for a file system in root and run "/bin/wine" in the file system with an argument of notepad

BoxedWine -root c:\root -zip wine.zip /bin/wine notepad

This will load the file system from wine.zip and write the changes to c:\root

* options

-bpp X : Value must be 16 or 32.  Most games are fine with 32-bit.

-cpuAffinity X : For multi-threaded builds, this will set the CPU affinity for the app/game.  Normally you should just pass in 1 if this is needed.  Some older games that use multiple threads sometimes require this.

-ddrawOverride path : will enabled CNC DDraw wrapper for the path passed in.  The path needs to be the full emulated file system path, for example, /home/username/.wine/drive_c/mdkperf/PERF_W95.EXE

-disableHideCursor : will prevent the cursor from being hidden

-dpiAware: will prevent Windows from scaling the screen if you are using display scaling.

-forceRelativeMouse : will force mouse capture and relative mouse input.  This is useful if the mouse doesn't work right in some games.

-fullscreen : if no resolution is passed in via the resolution command line argument then the resolution will be the same as the monitor

-fullscreenAspect : same as -fullscreen, but will show in letterbox format in order to maintain the aspect ratio

-gensrc : This is used for ahead of time (AOT) compiling and requires the source to be build with GENERATE_SOURCE.  With this enabled the user can run the program, then compile the output back into the program for a performance boost.  Currently I don't recommend using this, it should be considered experimental and the out put will not be compatible with future versions of BoxedWine.

-glext : If used, when Wine requests the list of OpenGL extension, it will be limited to this list.  This is only useful if the an old OpenGL game, like Unreal, can't handle the large list of extension a modern video card returns.  For Unreal I use:

    -glext "GL_EXT_multi_draw_arrays GL_ARB_vertex_program GL_ARB_fragment_program GL_ARB_multitexture GL_EXT_secondary_color GL_EXT_texture_lod_bias GL_NV_texture_env_combine4 GL_ATI_texture_env_combine3 GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic GL_ARB_texture_env_combine GL_EXT_texture_env_combine GL_EXT_texture_compression_s3tc GL_ARB_texture_compression GL_EXT_paletted_texture"

-log filePath : Will copy the output sent to the terminal to a file.  For example -log "c:\games\mygame\log.txt"

-mesa : If the build supports it, this option will select the off screen software Mesa OpenGL backend for renderering OpenGL.

-mount : Will mount a host directory or zip file, in the emulated file systems.  Example: -mount "c:\my games" "/home/username/my games" or -mount "c:\my games\mygame.zip" "/home/username/my games"

-mount_drive : Will mount a host directory in the emulate file system and set up the Wine links so that it shows up as a drive in Wine. Example: -mount_drive "c:\my games" d

-nosound : Will mute sounds, but the emulated program will still think they are being played

-novideo : Disable showing a window.  This is mainly used for running automated programs.

-nozip : if -zip command line is not supplied, Boxedwine might try to find a suitable zip file system.  If you don't want a default zip file system, you can specify the -nozip command line option.

-p2 : sets the emulated cpu to be a Pentium 2 with MMX

-p3 : sets the emulated cpu to be a Pentium 3 with MMX/SSE (default is Pentium 4)

-pollRate XX: XX is a number starting at 0.  This determines how fast mouse and keyboard events will be given to Wine.  The default is 40.  Setting it to 0 will make cause Boxedwine to give the events as fast as possible to Wine.

-resolution WxH : Initial emulated screen size.  Default is 800x600.  This is usual for apps/games that aren't full screen and won't change the screen size themselves.

-root path : Path to the file system the emulated linux environment will used

-scale X : Will scale the video output by this percentage, a value of 100 is normal.  A value of 200 will scale the screen by 2x, so 640x480 will display at 1280x960.  This option doesn't work with OpenGL, so for DirectDraw games, make sure to use the Wine GDI backend option.  The GDI option can be found in the Boxedwine UI in the container section, near the top, with the label "Renderer".  Or you can use regedit to set this yourself, see the Wine web site.

-title name : Will add name to the Boxedwine window

-uid X : Only useful if you want the emulated enviroment to report that it is root.  Useful if an app requires root privledges.  In that case set the uid to 0.

-vsync X : X can be 0, 1 or 2
    0 - Disabled: The frame rate can be faster than the monitor, but may introduce artifacts in the game.
    1 - Enabled: Synchronizes the frame rate of the app/game with the monitor refresh rate for better stability.
    2 - Adaptive: At high framerates, VSync is enabled to eliminate tearing. At low frame rates, it's disabled to minimise stuttering.  If the video card does not support this, then this option will act like Enabled.

-w path : Initial working directory, default is /home/username.  This path needs to reference a path in the emulated file system.

-zip path : This will load the file system from the zip file.  Use -root option for the location where new files can be created.  You can specify more than one -zip command line, like -zip 1.zip -zip 2.zip.  These will both be mounted in the root folder, "/".  If you want to mount a zip file somewhere else, use the -mount command.
