25.0.0
* Updated Wine to latest version
* Internal change to emulate x11 rather than replace winex11 driver.
* Linux file system is now based on Tiny Core Linux 15 instead of Debian 10.  This makes it easier to install packages from the Boxedwine UI.
* Normal (slow) CPU core for 32-bit systems can now use multiple threads.
* Mac ARMv8 systems are a lot more stable.

21.0.1

* Added command line option: -fullscreenAspect  This will enable full screen with letter boxing in order to preserve the aspect ratio.
* Added command line option: -vsync X where X is 0, 1 or 2.  0 is disabled, 1 is enabled and 2 is adaptive.  The default is 0 (disabled).
* Added command line option: -showWindowImmediately  This fixes simple OpenGL GLUT examples.
* OpenGL: Implemented glInterleavedArray, fixed glFeedbackBuffer and fixed glReadPixels when using packed formats.
* Recompiled Wine: will now use SSE for floating point math.  
* Rewrote the audio driver, now winealsa.drv.so will talk to Boxedwine directly.
* Added an implementation for ddraw.dll ddraw7_WaitForVerticalBlank.
* Lots of work on the Mac build.
* Windows build will use DirectX 9 for UI instead of OpenGL

20.1.2

* 64-bit Windows installer will now default to the correct Programe Files to install to.
* Added about 30 more supported extensions to OpenGL.
* Fixed fstat system call, it will now will report the correct size of the file
* Added SSE2 support for both the x64 and normal cores
* Fixed crash in custom winex11.drv and updated file systems to use it
* Launching Boxedwine without any command line arguments will now launch a new UI.  As long as the platform support OpenGL it should work with the UI.
* Windows UI is DPI aware

Known game fixes

  The installer works, the launcher works and Diablo works.  Hellfire does not work (same as Wine).

* MechWarrior 3 with Wine 4.0
* Tomb Raider 3 from GOG.com, need to add -setup to the command line and hit enter at the first black screen
