The goal of Boxedwine is to be able to run everything that Wine can.  If you want to know if your app or game will run in Boxedwine or get hints how to run it, you should start by looking at the [Wine Application Database (AppDB)](https://appdb.winehq.org/)\n## Supported Platforms:\n* Windows 32-bit (Vista or later)\n* Windows 64-bit (Vista or later)\n* Mac OSX\n* Linux (32-bit and 64-bit)\n* Web Browsers using WASM\n* Raspberry Pi (32-bit and 64-bit)\n## Current Version: " BOXEDWINE_VERSION_DISPLAY "\n*Added support for Wine 6.\n*Added DirectDraw Auto Refresh Option for apps.
